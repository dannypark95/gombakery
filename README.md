# Gom Bakery

Welcome to the Gom Bakery project repository. This repository contains the complete codebase for the Gom Bakery website, a full-stack application with both frontend and backend services.

## Structure

The project is structured into two main directories:

- `backend/` - Contains all the server-side code, including APIs, database models, and business logic.
- `frontend/` - Houses the client-side React application, with all the user interface components, styles, and client-side logic.
